# Vigilant

https://vigilant.vercel.app/

Premise of the application is for users to view crime around Vancouver. As we only had one week to create the application, the project is very bare-bones. The intention was to strengthen our design thinking instincts by using user-centered design practices to theorize solutions to Vancouver's rise in crime during the pandemic. As the project was created for a web development class, another objective of the project was to get well acquainted with using array methods as we would be workign with RESTful APIs a lot more later during that semester.
